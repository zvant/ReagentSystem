# ReagentSystem
A simple Client/Server program to manage reagemts in a laboratory.

When I was working at a chemistry laboratory two years ago, I noticed that the reagents management is quite messy. There is not a updated database for all the reagents we have, so anyone who wanted a reagent had to look for it everywhere without knowing if it even existed. So I write this program to maintain a database that records every reagent in the laboratory, including their name, basic information and quantity in stock.
